		    <h2>INTEGRAL Picture Of the Month December 2012: Polarised high-energy emission from the black hole candidate Cyg X-1</h2>
		    <p>Polarised high-energy radiation, interacting with the INTEGRAL/SPI detector plane, results in a spatial distribution of scattered photons, which depends on the polarisation angle. By comparing theoretical patterns with the observed distribution, the position angle and polarisation fraction of the high-energy emission of Cygnus X-1 have been obtained.
		    Cygnus X-1 is one of the strongest persistent sources in the X/gamma-ray sky and it is considered as the prototype of black hole candidates in binary systems. Its spectral emission has motivated most of the theoretical work dedicated to production mechanisms of high-energy photons; however, these mechanisms are not fully understood.
		    In particular, the spectral shape between 10 keV and ~1 MeV requires two spectral components (roughly below and above 250 keV).
		    A big step forward has been made with the recent detection of polarised emission in the high-energy part of the spectrum: after the first measurements using the so-called "Compton" mode in INTEGRAL/IBIS data (Laurent et al., 2011, see POM April 2011), the analysis of the INTEGRAL/SPI data permits to independently confirm and refine this result.
		    Firstly, the SPI data give a mean value of the polarisation angle of 42° +/- 3°, now confirmed by IBIS. Secondly, while the IBIS Compton mode detected a polarised flux above 400 keV and not below, the SPI data can be divided into 3 bands to allow studying the evolution of the polarisation fraction as a function of energy. An upper limit of 20% between 130 and 230 keV has been found, and a polarised flux (41%) between 230 and 370 keV was detected. In the highest energy part of the detected emission, (370-850 keV), the flux is almost completely polarised, or at least with a fraction greater than 75%.
		    Such results strongly support an ordered structure like a jet being responsible of the observed emission. This confirms the scenario proposed by Laurent et al (2011), in which two photon production mechanisms coexist in the hard-X ray/gamma-ray domain: (i) the Comptonisation emission of the disk-corona system plays the main role above 10 keV with a cut off around 100-200 keV, while (ii) the jet synchrotron radiation extending from the radio to the hard-X ray/gamma-ray domain is dominating above 200 keV up to the MeV region.
		    Finally, the detection of a polarised signal in a spectrum accumulated over 6.5 years implies a high stability of the source, however, further studies are required to understand the source characteristics.</p>

                    <p>Born in 1983, I studied Mathematics in La Rochelle before I moved to Toulouse to study fundamental physics and space sciences. I successfully defended my PhD on hard X-ray telescopes in 2011 and I'm currently working as a postdoctoral research assistent on hard X-ray polarization. I also devote time to the design and development of future instruments for high energy astronomy.</p>
